My GitHub account was created using my personal Email as this is something that I see myself using in the future and outside of this class and the account is named after my favoirte animal the fox or in Japanese "kitsune".
The repository I made is a private repository named after my GitHub account.
To create a clone of my repository I simply downloaded the desktop app which simplifed the process and only needed me to choose a location on where I wanted to store it. After choosing the location I then however needed to open command prompt to add this "README.md" file.       
I had to write this in command prompt-
echo "# kitsune.github.io" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/Kitsune-21/kitsune.github.io.git
git push -u origin main
After this I was done with this set up process.
